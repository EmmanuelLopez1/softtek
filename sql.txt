SQL:
-SET is a clause that indicates the column to edit.
	-UPDATE celebs 
	SET twitter_handle = '@taylorswift13' 
	WHERE id = 4; 
-The ALTER statement is used to modify columns. With ALTER, you can add columns, remove them, or even modify them.
-The UPDATE statement is used to modify rows. However, UPDATE can only update a row, and cannot remove or add rows.
-DISTINCT: is used to return unique values in the output. It filters out all duplicate values in the specified column(s).
-SELECT:is a special operator used with the WHERE clause to search for a specific pattern in a column.
	_: The _ means you can substitute any individual character here without breaking the pattern. The names Seven and Se7en both match this pattern.
	%: It's helpfull to find word that start and end with specific caracters.
-BETWEEN: The BETWEEN operator is used in a WHERE clause to filter the result set within a certain range. 
-ORDER BY: 
	-ORDER BY year DESC.
	-ORDER BY year ASC.
-LIMIT:	is a clause that lets you specify the maximum number of rows the result set will have.
-CASE: IS THE IF / ELSE IN SQL.
-AS: renames a column or table.	

//CALCULATIONS.
-COUNT() is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and counts the number of non-empty values in that column.
-SUM() is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and returns the sum of all the values in that column.
-The MAX() and MIN() functions return the highest and lowest values in a column, respectively.
-SQL uses the AVG() function to quickly calculate the average value of a particular column.
-round(): It rounds the values in the column to the number of decimal places specified by the integer.
-GROUP BY is a clause in SQL that is used with aggregate functions. It is used in collaboration with the SELECT statement to arrange identical data into groups.

//HAVING AND WHERE:
-When we want to limit the results of a query based on values of the individual rows, use WHERE.
-When we want to limit the results of a query based on an aggregate property, use HAVING.
-HAVING statement always comes after GROUP BY, but before ORDER BY and LIMIT.

//FUNCTIONS
-strftime() function - a very powerful function that allows you to return a formatted date.

//WORKING WITH SEVERAL TABLES;
-JOIN: Lets us join two tables or more.
-ON: Specify the condition to join the tables.
-LEFT JOIN: A left join will keep all rows from the first table, regardless of whether there is a matching row in the second table.
The final result will keep all rows of the first table but will omit the un-matched row from the second table.
FOREIGN ID:When the primary key for one table appears in a different table
-Foreign keys: will have more descriptive names.
-CROSS JOIN:to combine all rows of one table with all rows of another table.
-UNION: Sometimes we just want to stack one dataset on top of the other. Well, the UNION operator allows us to do that.
	SQL has strict rules for appending data:
		Tables must have the same number of columns.
		The columns must have the same data types in the same order as the first table.
-WITH: to combine two tables, but one of the tables is the result of another calculation.
-Generally, the primary key will just be called id.
